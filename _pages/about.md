I am an economics PhD candidate at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/econ/). My research is centered around applied and theoretical econometrics with applications to labor and health economics. I am interested in developing econometric and statistical tools to better understand distributional outcomes and to flexibly estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of regulatory and welfare policies on outcomes of interest. 

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MPhil in Economics at [Oxford University](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk) (St. Cross College) and an Honours BSc in Economics, Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca) (Trinity College).

<small> The changes-in-changes method, developed by Athey and Imbens (2006), is a powerful tool for identifying the distributional effects of a policy intervention, allowing for endogenous treatment assignment and full counterfactual distribution identification. However, challenges with incorporating control variables to address concerns akin to differential parallel trends in the difference-in-differences literature persist. In this paper, I propose a semiparametric approach to changes-in-changes based on distribution regression that can flexibly account for observed confounders. This approach can be applied to continuous and/or discrete outcome variables. I derive functional central limit theorems for the distribution regression based changes-in-changes estimator and for functionals thereof. These include unconditional distributional and quantile treatment effects, average treatment effects, and decompositional treatment effects for the treated group. Bootstrap validity result is also provided for conducting inference in practice. Lastly, I apply the approach to study the heterogeneous effects of Earned Income Tax Credit on infant weights and find that the policy had higher concentrated benefits for lower birth weights and more muted effects across the birth weight distribution than previously reported. </small>
